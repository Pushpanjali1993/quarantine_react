This is basic react application which uses props, state, route etc basic functionality.

In this i am rendering thorugh Pluralsights website by using my mock APIs.

Mock APIs are created using JSON Server.

Basic Scripts used for running the app:

# npm Start :

This will run application along with API server

# npm start:api -

This will run the API on API Server.
